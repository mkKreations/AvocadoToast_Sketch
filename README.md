## Description

This repo contains two Sketch projects which were used to create all assets
used within the AvocadoToast iOS app. One Sketch project is dedicated to 
creating the assets, whereas the other was used to create the app icon. This
git repo was primarily managed using [Kactus](https://kactus.io/), a git-GUI,
since most of Sketch files are large image files and JSON.


## Screenshots
